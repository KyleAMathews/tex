# TeX: Miscellany

I'm going to start keeping my publicly-available LaTeX sources here just in case anyone else wants to play with them.

These will skew towards the typesetting needs of literature scholarship.

## Templates

Model source files of the kind I use as a template for new documents.

## Class files

Just a curio here, for now: the documentclass used to typeset my Ph.D. thesis.

## Introductory material

Files to play with if you are new to LaTeX.

## More

I'm sporadically blogging about humanities TeXing at [humtex.wordpress.com](http://humtex.wordpress.com).
