% DOCUMENT PREAMBLE

% Your professor has asked for twelve-point font, right? Here it is.
\documentclass[12pt]{article}



% MULTILINGUAL SUPPORT
%
% With this you can enter accented characters as Unicode directly. Make
% sure your text editor saves your file with utf8 encoding. Support for
% non-Western-European scripts requires further packages, and support
% for writing long texts in other W. European languages requires loading
% different options for babel. But this is english-paper.tex, not
% french-paper.tex.

\usepackage[english]{babel}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% PAGE DESIGN
%
% Here's where I'm going to be bold. We're going to let LaTeX choose the
% measure (i.e. width of the text) instead of using the conventional
% one-inch margins. But if you want to alter the margins, uncomment the
% next two lines and set width and height as you wish.

%\usepackage{geometry} 
%\geometry{width=6.0 in, height=8.5 in}

% And we'll let LaTeX keep its default leading. Instead of
% double-spacing, we'll have the wide margins of the page for comments
% by your reader. The amount of text on the page will be pretty close
% to the same as you'd get from double-spaced with 6-inch measure. But
% the page will not be ugly. HOWEVER, if you must supply a double-spaced
% printout to your professor, uncomment the next two lines.

%\usepackage{setspace}
%\doublespacing

% If you wish to cheat on spacing, you can delete the \doublespacing
% command and use a different factor, like this:
%
% \setstretch{1.5} 

% FONTS
%
% So the default LaTeX font, Computer Modern, is not ideal for setting
% the text of an English paper. It is designed to look good when you are
% writing equations. There are many, many ways to do different fonts in
% LaTeX, but this is meant to be a safe template file you can use on any
% platform, so we are going to stick with built-in options. Of these
% I think Palatino is the best choice; it's supplied by the mathpazo
% package.  
\usepackage{mathpazo}

% You could also choose a Times-like font with this line instead:
%
% \usepackage{mathptmx}
%
% But remember that Times is not really meant for setting full pages of
% text. It was designed to be readable in tight newspaper columns on
% newsprint. It's pretty painful for the screen and not great for white
% paper and inkjet/laser toner.

% HEADERS AND FOOTERS
% The ``pagestyle'' controls things like headers and footers.
% fancyhdr allows finer control.
\usepackage{fancyhdr}
\pagestyle{fancy}
% Now we modify this ``fancy'' style.
% Fancyheader puts rules on your page: too heavy-handed.
\renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0 pt}
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0 pt}
% These control the left, center, and right headers and footers 
% On a paper, just have your name and the page in the upper right.
\lhead{}
\chead{}
\rhead{\small YOUR NAME HERE \thepage}
\lfoot{}
\cfoot{}
\rfoot{}

% A little extra refinement: the first page should have different headers
% Which we can do by redefining the ``plain'' pagestyle and applying it to p. 1
\fancypagestyle{plain}{%
    \lhead{}
    \chead{}
    \rhead{\small YOUR NAME HERE \\ THE DATE}
    \fancyfoot{}
    \cfoot{\small \thepage}
    \renewcommand{\footrulewidth}{0 pt} 
    \renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0 pt}}

% Simpler alternative:
% ``plain'' style puts the page number at the center bottom.
% \pagestyle{plain}

% BIBLIOGRAPHY: the shortcut
%
% You should always cite your sources carefully. In this most
% basic template, I suggest simply typing up a Works Cited page or
% bibliography manually. Ultimately it's better to use the biblatex
% package to generate a bibligraphy, and it's also good to develop a
% database of all the sources you use over time. But since it takes some
% effort to learn to use biblatex, I think paper writers should get
% started on LaTeX without it. So all you need to type up a bibliography
% manually is two things: something to typeset hanging paragraphs (first
% line set flush left, subsequent lines indented), and a command to
% produce a long dash for repeated author names.

\usepackage{hanging}
\newcommand{\threeEmDash}{---------}

% The following incantation ensures that no section numbers will be
% typeset:

\setcounter{secnumdepth}{-2}

% DOCUMENT BODY
\begin{document}
% To get ``plain'' pagestyle on p. 1
\thispagestyle{plain}

\begin{center}
\textbf{Title of Paper: Professors Like Titles}
\end{center}

\noindent First paragraph: not indented.


\begin{quote}
A blockquote.

% an example of a forced pagebreak, should you ever need it
\newpage

% You can use BibLaTeX to automatically generate citations and bibliography,
% and indeed you should,
% but this is meant to be a more basic file, and if you are writing a paper about only one source, it's okay to do this by hand. Here's how:

\section{Works Cited}

\begin{hangparas}{\parindent}{1}
Lastname, Firstname. \emph{Title}. Location: Publisher, Year. Print.

\threeEmDash. \emph{Title}. Location: Publisher, Year. Medium.
\end{hangparas}

% END OF DOCUMENT BODY
\end{document}  
% END OF DOCUMENT
% Nothing here will be typeset
