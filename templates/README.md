# Templates

I use files like these as the basis for each new LaTeX document.

## xepreamble.tex

A model empty document, to be processed with xelatex.

## xebibpreamble.tex

A model empty document, including bibliography setup with biblatex-chicago. To be processed with xelatex and biber.

## english-paper.xe.tex

A sample document showing how students could set up a paper for an undergraduate English course in LaTeX. Process with xelatex.

## english-paper.tex

The same sample English paper, but setup for pdflatex processing (in case xelatex doesn't work on your system).
